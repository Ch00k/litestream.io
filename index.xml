If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Litestream, you should walk through the Replicating a Single Database tutorial first. That will get you running a simple Litestream setup.
If you want to run Litestream in production, you should learn to deploy it as a service by reading the Running as a systemd service tutorial.</description></item><item><title>How it works</title><link>https://litestream.io/how-it-works/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://litestream.io/how-it-works/</guid><description>Litestream is a streaming replication tool for SQLite databases. It runs as a separate background process and continuously copies write-ahead log pages from disk to one or more replicas. This asynchronous replication provides disaster recovery similar to what is available with database servers like Postgres or MySQL.
Understanding the WAL SQLite has a journaling mode called &amp;ldquo;WAL&amp;rdquo; (write-ahead log) which writes database page changes to a separate -wal file first before later copying those pages back into the main database file.</description></item><item><title>Install</title><link>https://litestream.io/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://litestream.io/install/</guid><description>Overview Most users should install Litestream using prebuilt binaries as they make it easy to get up and running quickly.

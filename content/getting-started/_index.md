This tutorial will get you up and running with Litestream locally and
replicating a SQLite database to Amazon S3. By the end, you'll understand the
`replicate` and `restore` commands and be able to continuously backup your
database. This tutorial assumes you're comfortable on the command line.

Before continuing, [please install Litestream on your local machine](/install).

## Overview

These tutorials provide a way to get up and running with Litestream quickly.
If you're new to Litestream, you should walk through the [Replicating a Single Database](/getting-started/basic)
tutorial first. That will get you running a simple Litestream setup.

If you want to run Litestream in production, you should learn to deploy it as
a service by reading the [Running as a systemd service](/getting-started/systemd)
tutorial.

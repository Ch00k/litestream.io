## Installation

Most users should follow the steps above to install prebuilt binaries but you
can also install from source if a binary is not provided for your operating
system or architecture. First, [install the Go toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/).

Next, download the source code and run the following command:

```sh
go install ./cmd/litestream
```

This will install `litestream` into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
